# AI-Powered-News-Verifier
This project is a Jupyter-friendly implementation of a multi-agentic fake-news detection system built using the AI Development Kit (ADK). It’s inspired by the AI Intensive course from Google x Kaggle and demonstrates how to assemble conversational agents, tool integrations, and shared memory into a coherent pipeline.
